## Contributing Notes

To add notes, make a `.md` file in the content/ folder. Thats it! You can embed images, format text, and make folders.

Check out [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/help/) for a quick guide, or [Obsidian Markdown](https://help.obsidian.md/syntax), for the specific flavor we support for advanced things like call outs and diagrams.

- In doubt, ask someone listed in the repo or FilmExperiments organization!
